**Question**

Pick three quotes from the readings about language design. Good candidates
are:

- Something you agreed with / resonates with your own experience
- Something you disagree with
- Something that is interesting, a new idea or perspective you'd like to remember
- Something you didn't understand

For each quote, describe what it was about the quote that led you pick it.

-  A master plan leads to "When people lose the sense of responsibility for the environment they live in, and realize that they are merely cogs in someone else’s machine, how can they feel any sense of identification with the community, or any sense of purpose there?" [Steele, 1998]

I feel like this is a very meaningful quote. Now of course you could use it as an analysis of the human condition, but even within the context of *specifically* design it really emphasizes art and creation as community (a home). We as programmers are a community, and the langauges we design (regardless of who for) require passion and dedication that leads to purpose. If we allow the industry to be dominated by a "master plan" in this context we will lose that community and purpose. 

- Every piece of software we use was written by other people, slaving away over thousands of lines of code. Why shouldn’t those “interfaces” be as humanely designed as the ones we tap and swipe?  [Pavlus, 2012]

I like this one compares programming and software design to mobile games and more :"consumer" based products. Treating ourselves (programmers) as above consumers is foolish. While we are experts we don't need more then they do, nor should we maintain a difficulty that only we can master. Only with clear and *humane* interfaces can we code effectively. Its healthier for everyone and the product to design everything for everyone. 

- "You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally." [Bloch, 2006]

I disagree >:(. I feel while pleasing everyone is impossible, it is shooting yourself in the foot to act as if you can't. **Aim to please everyone despite the fact you will displease everyone equally in the end** is a better version of this phrase. Shoot for the moon, you might reach the stars kinda thing. You will be suprised how close you get to pleasing everyone.

**Question**

The Pavlus article mentions the researchers' comments that people preferred
"natural-language replacements for some of the more abstruse syntax". In other
words, people found it easier to work with code that looks more like a human language (e.g.,
English). Consider the following quote by William R. Cook, one of the creators
of AppleScript:

> The experiment in designing a language that resembled natural languages (English
> and Japanese) was not successful. It was assumed that scripts should be
> presented in “natural language” so that average people could read and write
> them. … In the end the syntactic variations and flexibility did more to confuse
> programmers than to help them out. It is not clear whether it is easier for
> novice users to work with a scripting language that resembles natural language,
> with all its special cases and idiosyncrasies. The main problem is that
> AppleScript only appears to be a natural language: in fact, it is an artificial
> language, like any other programming language. … even small changes to the
> script may introduce subtle syntactic errors that baffle users. It is easy to
> read AppleScript, but quite hard to write it.
> [[Cook 2007, page 1-20]](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238845)

Are these two experiences of natural languages at odds with one another? Would
you choose to include natural language in the design of a DSL? If so, how might
you do so? If not, why not?
