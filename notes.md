This is a notes file :) Just gonna take some notes while I read 

[Steele, 1998]
Reminds me alot of discussions in PLs obviously. 
"Eric Raymond says that it is fine to come
up with good thoughts, but much better to know them when you see them in the work of
other persons." 
A master plan leads to "When people lose the sense of responsibility for the environment they
live in, and realize that they are merely cogs in someone else’s machine, how
can they feel any sense of identification with the community, or any sense of
purpose there?"
"Now programs are big messes with many needs. A small language won’t do the job.
If you design a big language all at once and then try to build it all at once, you will fail.
You will end up late and some other language that is small will take your place"
"Parts of the language must be designed to help the task of growth."
