This is a notes file :) Just gonna take some notes while I read 

[Steele, 1998]
Reminds me alot of discussions in PLs obviously. 

"Eric Raymond says that it is fine to come
up with good thoughts, but much better to know them when you see them in the work of
other persons." 

A master plan leads to "When people lose the sense of responsibility for the environment they
live in, and realize that they are merely cogs in someone else’s machine, how
can they feel any sense of identification with the community, or any sense of
purpose there?"

"Now programs are big messes with many needs. A small language won’t do the job.
If you design a big language all at once and then try to build it all at once, you will fail.
You will end up late and some other language that is small will take your place"
"Parts of the language must be designed to help the task of growth."


** [Pavlus, 2012]**

"this reaction isn’t just because you’re a n00b: they found that Perl, a major programming language used by untold zillions of developers, is no more intuitive to novices than a language with a randomly generated syntax."
"Every piece of software we use was written by other people, slaving away over thousands of lines of code. Why shouldn’t those “interfaces” be as humanely designed as the ones we tap and swipe?"


[Bloch, 2006]

"All programmers are API designers." 

"You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally."

"Names matter. Strive for intelligibility, consistency, and symmetry. Every API is a little language, and people must learn to read and write it. If you get an API right, code will read like prose"

"API design is an art, not a science. Strive for beauty, and trust your gut. Do not adhere slavishly to the above heuristics, but violate them only infrequently and with good reason."
